# Abstract for NUMBAT presentation

This talk will present the R package called triad. It is being developed as a Google Summer of Code 2022 project. The package computes a standard Delaunay triangulation of a set of 2D points. The motivation is that an original implementation in the package tripack, used FORTRAN with a ACM license which is now conflicting with CRAN policy of only open source licenses. Delaunay triangulation forms the basis of many scagnostic calculations, as available in the R package cassowaryr. I will discuss my choice of a particular algorithm, the challenges of coding the algorithm, some of the difficult steps and how I overcame them.

This work is being conducted jointly with Di Cook and Harriet Mason.
